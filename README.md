Reasons to use the MIT License:

1. Simplicity and Permissiveness
2. Wide Acceptance & Compatibility
3. Encourages Collaboration
4. Reduces Legal Complexity
5. Promotes & Furthers Open Source
6. Protects Against Liability


All of these things combined make the MIT license a great option when creating software/web apps that you want people to have visibility as well as potentially contribute to.
